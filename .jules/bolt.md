## 2024-07-22 - Non-blocking CPU-Bound Tasks in Asyncio

**Learning:** I discovered a performance bottleneck in `core/trading_engine.py` where a CPU-bound operation, `technical_indicators.add_all_indicators`, was blocking the `asyncio` event loop. Even though the I/O operations were concurrent, this synchronous calculation serialized the execution, negating the benefits of `asyncio.gather`.

**Action:** In the future, I will use `asyncio.to_thread` to run any CPU-bound function in a separate thread. This will keep the event loop free and ensure that both I/O and CPU-bound tasks can run in parallel, maximizing throughput.
